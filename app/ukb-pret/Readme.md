# UK Biobank PRS Release Evaluation Tool

This is the source code for the `ukb-pret` applet.

The `ukb-pret` applet can be run on the DNANexus platform to compare a user's Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) against 
the Enhanced PRS provided by UK Biobank (UKB) and Genomics plc from the UKB PRS Release.

Full instructions on how to build and run the applet can be found in the `ukb-pret` repository README: 
https://github.com/Genomicsplc/ukb-pret/blob/main/README.md.

For more information about how to run or modify applets, see
